              "No one is born hating another person because of the color of his
              skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to
              hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love,
              for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its
              opposite."

              "I know of no single formula for success. But over the years I
              have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal and
              are often about finding ways of encouraging people to combine
              their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm,
              and their inspiration to work together."
